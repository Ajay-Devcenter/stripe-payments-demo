# Stripe Payments Demo

This demo features a sample e-commerce store that uses [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) and the [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources) to illustrate how to accept both card payments and additional payment methods on the web.

If you‚Äôre running a compatible browser, this demo also showcases the [Payment Request API](https://stripe.com/docs/payment-request-api), [Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay), and [Google Pay](https://stripe.com/docs/google-pay) for a seamless payment experience.

**You can see this demo app running in test mode on [stripe-payments-demo.appspot.com](https://stripe-payments-demo.appspot.com).**

This demo provides an all-in-one example for integrating with Stripe on the web:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
|     | Features
:---: | :---
‚ú® | **Beautiful UI components for card payments**. This demo uses pre-built Stripe components customized to fit the app design, including the [Card Element](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) which provides real-time validation, formatting, and autofill.
üí≥ | **Card payments with Payment Request, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.** The app offers frictionless card payment experiences with a single integration using the new [Payment Request Button Element](https://stripe.com/docs/elements/payment-request-button).
üåç | **Payment methods for Europe and Asia.** A dozen redirect-based payment methods are supported through the [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources), from iDEAL to WeChat Pay.
üé© | **Automatic payment methods suggestion.** Picking a country will automatically show relevant payment methods. For example, selecting  ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù will suggest SOFORT, Giropay, and SEPA Debit.
üîê | **Dynamic 3D Secure for Visa and Mastercard.** The app automatically handles the correct flow to complete card payments with [3D Secure](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/three-d-secure), whether it‚Äôs required by the card or by the app above a certain amount.
üì≤ | **QR code generation for WeChat Pay.** During the payment process for [WeChat Pay](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#wechat-pay), a QR code is generated for the WeChat Pay URL to authorize the payment in the WeChat app.
üöÄ | **Built-in proxy for local HTTPS and webhooks.** Card payments require HTTPS and asynchronous payment methods with redirects rely on webhooks to complete transactions‚Äî[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is integrated so the app is served locally over HTTPS and an endpoint is publicly exposed for webhooks.
üîß | **Webhook signing and idempotency keys**. We verify webhook signatures and pass idempotency keys to charge creations, two recommended practices for asynchronous payment flows.
üì± | **Responsive design**. The checkout experience works on all screen sizes. Apple Pay works on Safari for iPhone and iPad if the Wallet is enabled, and Payment Request works on Chrome for Android.
üì¶ | **No datastore required.** Products, SKUs, and Orders are stored using the [Stripe Orders API](https://stripe.com/docs/orders), which you can replace with your own database to keep track of orders and inventory.

## Payments Integration

[`public/javascripts/payments.js`](public/javascripts/payments.js) contains the core logic of the Stripe integration and creates the payment experience on the frontend using Stripe Elements.

### Card Payments with Stripe Elements

[Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) let you quickly support cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the new Payment Request API.

Stripe Elements are rich, pre-built UI components that create optimized checkout flows across desktop and mobile. Elements can accept any CSS property to perfectly match the look-and-feel of your app. They simplify the time-consuming parts when building payment forms, e.g. input validation, formatting, localization, and cross-browser support.

This demo uses both the [Card Element](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) and the [Payment Request Button](https://stripe.com/docs/elements/payment-request-button), which provides a single integration for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Payment Request API‚Äîa new browser standard that allows your customers to quickly provide payment and address information they‚Äôve stored with their browser.

### Beyond Cards: Payments Sources for Europe and Asia

This demo also shows how to reach customers in Europe and Asia by supporting their preferred way to pay online. It supports payment methods such as [ACH credit transfers](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#ach-credit-transfers), [Alipay](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#alipay), [Bancontact](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#bancontact), [iDEAL](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#ideal), [Giropay](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#giropay), [SEPA Direct Debit](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#sepa), [SOFORT](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#sofort), and [WeChat Pay](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#wechat).

The app also supports both [Multibanco](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/multibanco) and [EPS](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/eps) which are currently in Public Beta on Stripe.

The [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources) provides a single integration for all these payment methods. You can support new payment methods without changing a line of code, simply by activating it them in the [Payments Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payments/settings) of your Stripe Dashboard.
